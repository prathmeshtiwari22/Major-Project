# 📚 Gamified Platform for Engineering Education using NLP 🎮📖

A React Native-powered mobile platform designed to enhance engineering education through gamification and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The platform dynamically generates subject-specific problem sets, tracks student progress with gamified features like streaks and levels, and provides essential academic resources such as notes, video lectures, and past papers — all in one intuitive mobile app.

## 📌 Features

- 🎮 **Gamified Learning Environment**  
  Level-based progression, streaks, badges, and leaderboards to make learning interactive and engaging.

- 🤖 **NLP-Based Dynamic Question Generation**  
  Uses T5 and BERT models to generate personalized, adaptive question sets based on each student's learning progress.

- 📈 **Adaptive Learning Engine**  
  Employs the Leitner system and Bayesian Knowledge Tracing for tailored question scheduling and concept mastery tracking.

- 📄 **Notes & Past Papers Access**  
  Semester-wise categorized notes and exam papers integrated within the app for efficient preparation.

- 🎥 **Video Lecture Integration**  
  Includes subject-relevant visual and auditory resources to enhance concept clarity.

- 🔒 **Secure User Management**  
  JWT-based authentication with MongoDB to securely handle user credentials and profiles.

- 📊 **Progress Dashboards**  
  Real-time tracking of user performance, streaks, and learning outcomes.
